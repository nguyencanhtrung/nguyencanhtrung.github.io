## Command-line

All programs such as `quartus_pgm`, `jtagconfig`, etc. locate in the Quartus installation folder or in the standard alone FPGA programmer folder.

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/administrator/data/intelFPGA_pro/21.3/qprogrammer/quartus/linux64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=/home/administrator/data/intelFPGA_pro/21.3/qprogrammer/quartus/bin:$PATH
```
Exporting the library and programs to use in the latter sections.


### JTAG scanning

To list all devices that are found (the cable is auto-detected)

```bash
quartus_pgm --auto
```

Note that listing the devices as shown above is not necessary for loading the bitstream. It might be useful to tell the position of the FPGA in the JTAG chain, maybe. Really something that is done once to explore the board.

In case, the server has more than one programming cable, the program could not enumerate position of FPGA in the JTAG chain.

<d-code block language="bash">
$ quartus_pgm --auto
Error (213043): More than one programming cable found in available hardware list 
    -- use --list option to display available hardware list and specify correct 
    programming cable
</d-code>

Lets use following command

```bash
quartus_pgm --list
```

<d-code block language="bash">
$ quartus_pgm --list

There are 2 JTAG cables USB-Blaster and USB-BlasterII. Now we can check which devices connect with each JTAG cable

```bash
jtagconfig -n
```

OR

```bash
jtagconfig -d
```

$ jtagconfig -n

Cable 2 (USB-BlasterII) is connected to Stratix 10 GX board (1SG280HH)


### JTAGD deamon

This deamon listens to TCP/IP port 1309. It is responsible for talking with the JTAG adapter through the USB bus, so both the GUI programmer and command line tool rely on it. If there’s no daemon running, both of these start it.

But if you use multiple versions of Quartus, this may be a source of confusion, in particular if you make a first attempt to load an FPGA with an older version, and then try a newer one. That’s because the newer version of Quartus will keep using the older version of jtagd. And this older jtagd may not support FPGAs that the newer version of Quartus does. So the conclusion is that if weird things happen, this may fix it, and won’t hurt anyhow:

```bash
killall jtagd
```
### Programming FPGA

`quartus_pgm` displays most of its output in green text. Generally speaking, if there’s no text in red, all went fine.

```bash
quartus_pgm -m jtag -o "p;path/to/file.sof"
```

Alternatively, add the position of the JTAG in the JTAG chain explicitly (in particular if it’s not the first device). In this case it’s @1, meaning it’s the first device in the JTAG chain. If it’s the second device, pick @2 etc.

<d-code block language="bash">
$ quartus_pgm -m jtag -o "p;path/to/file.sof@1"

If anything goes wrong — device mismatch, a failure to scan the JTAG chain or anything else, it will be hard to miss that, because of the errors written in red. The good thing with the command line interface is that every attempt starts everything from the beginning, so just turn the board on and try again.

<b>In case, having multiple Jtag cables plugged in. It it neccessary to specify which cable to program.</b>


```bash
quartus_pgm -c $1 -m JTAG -o p\;$BITSTREAM@$2
```

`$BITSTREAM` path to bitstream

`$1` position of JTAG cable

`$2` position of FPGA device in the JTAG chain

Example:

<d-code block language="bash">
$ jtagconfig -n
1) USB-Blaster [3-5.3]
  Unable to read device chain - JTAG chain broken

2) USB-BlasterII [3-5.4]

    + Node 0C006E00  JTAG UART #0

3) USB-Blaster on dash.soc.one [3-5.3]

    + Node 0C006E00  JTAG UART #0

5) Remote server dash.soc.one:1310: Unable to connect
</d-code>

Lets program the 2nd cable (USB-BlasterII) - the FPGA device (stratix 10 GX is at the first position of JTAG chain)

```bash
quartus_pgm -c 2 -m JTAG -o p\;$BITSTREAM@1
```


## Issues

### Cyclone 10 GX FPGA development kit

This board caused me some extra trouble, so a few words about it. When this board is connected to a computer, it appears as 09fb:6810, however after attempting to load the FPGA (note the "@2" in the end) with:

<d-code block language="bash">
$ quartus_pgm -m jtag -o "p;thecode.sof@2"
Error (213019): Can't scan JTAG chain. Error code 86.
</d-code>

The device's ID changes to 09fb:6010. So there's clearly some reprogramming of the firmware (the system log shows a disconnection and reconnection with the new ID). The board is detected as GX0000406 by Quartus' GUI Programming Tool, but clicking "Auto Detect" results in "Unable to scan device chain. Hardware is not connected".

OK, so how about trying a scan?

<d-code block language="bash">
$ quartus_pgm --auto
[ ... ]
Info (213045): Using programming cable "10CGX0000406 [1-5.1.2]"
1) 10CGX0000406 [1-5.1.2]
  Unable to read device chain - Hardware not attached
</d-code>

The problem in my case was apparently that the jtagd that was running was started by an older version of Quartus, which didn’t recognize Cyclone 10 devices. So follow the advice above, and kill it. After that, programming with the command above worked with Quartus Pro 17.1:

<d-code block language="bash">
$ quartus_pgm --auto
[...]
Info (213045): Using programming cable "USB-BlasterII [1-5.1.2]"
1) USB-BlasterII [1-5.1.2]
  031820DD   10M08SA(.|ES)/10M08SC
  02E120DD   10CX220Y
</d-code>


### Mismatch JTAG ID

The design is deployed on Stratix 10 GX development kit which contains FPGA chip "1SG280HU2F50E2VG". However, setting the same device and generating bitstream, programing it on the device prompts following error.

<d-code block language="bash">

#### Debugging flow

* <b> Check the order of Jtag cable</b>
* <b> Check the position of FPGA chip</b>

```bash
jtagconfig -d
1) USB-Blaster [3-3.3]
   (JTAG Server Version 21.3.0 Build 170 09/23/2021 SC Pro Edition)
  Unable to read device chain - JTAG chain broken

  Captured DR after reset = ()
  Captured IR after reset = ()
  Captured Bypass after reset = ()
  Captured Bypass chain = ()
  JTAG clock speed 6 MHz

2) USB-BlasterII [3-3.4]
   (JTAG Server Version 21.3.0 Build 170 09/23/2021 SC Pro Edition)
  C32150DD   1SG280HH(1S2|2S2|3S2)/.. (IR=10)
    Design hash    D41D8CD98F00B204E980
    + Node 08986E00  Nios V #0

  Captured DR after reset = (C32150DD) [32]
  Captured IR after reset = (001) [10]
  Captured Bypass after reset = (0) [1]
  Captured Bypass chain = (0) [1]
  JTAG clock speed auto-adjustment is enabled. To disable, set JtagClockAutoAdjust parameter to 0
  JTAG clock speed 24 MHz

3) Remote server dash.soc.one: Unable to connect

   (JTAG Server version information not available)
4) Remote server dash.soc.one:1310: Unable to connect

   (JTAG Server version information not available)

```

The log means: The target is programmed through 2nd cable (USB-BlasterII) and the position of FPGA chip is the first position.
  `C32150DD   1SG280HH(1S2|2S2|3S2)/.. (IR=10)`

If it shows like
```bash
1) USB-BlasterII [1-2.3]
020A40DD 5M(1270ZF324|2210Z)/EPM2210
C32250DD 1SG280HH1(.|S3|AS)/1SG280HH2/..
```
that means FPGA chip located in the second position, the first position is chip 1270ZF324

In the command, I set correct parameters for cable order and position of FPGA chip

* <b> Check the JTAG ID and its corresponding chip</b>

The reference is <a href="https://bsdl.info/list.htm?f=828&page=1&sort=name&sorttype=true">here</a>

It turns out the target FPGA is `1SG280LU2F50E2VG` that corresponds to `Jtag ID: 0xC32250DD`. This is L-Tile version of GX development kit. Our first assumption is H-Tile version.
