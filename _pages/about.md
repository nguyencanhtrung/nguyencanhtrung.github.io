Hello, this is Nguyen Canh Trung. You can call me "Trung".


I am an FPGA developer who works mainly in 5G communication sector. I had spent the first 3-years to work as a system integration for 5G-RRU (Remote Radio Unit) which focusing on high-speed interfaces such as `JESD204B`, `eCPRI` and `PCIe`. The other part of the job was to integrate `DPD`, `CFR` and `LOW PHY` solutions into fabric.

Later on, my works was focusing on designing and implementing IP cores for Xilinx and Intel platforms which includes 5G-NR Layer 1 and ISP accelerators. 

Currently, I am participating in a project to design a "5G-verification system" (5G testbed). I am proficient at both `Traditional RTL design flow` and `High Level Synthesis design flow`. 

During my working time, I realize that I need a space to summarize what I have learned. It can also be a place that I can share my knowledge and experience to someone that may need. This website is a result of the process.

I hope you can find something interesting here. Feel free to drop me a line via email!

Thank you!
