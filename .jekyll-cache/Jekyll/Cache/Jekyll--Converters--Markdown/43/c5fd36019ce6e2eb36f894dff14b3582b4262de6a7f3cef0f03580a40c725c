<p>Resets in PCI express are a bit complex. There are two main types of resets - conventional reset, and function-level reset. There are also two types of conventional resets, fundamental resets and non-fundamental resets. See the PCI express specification for all of the details.</p>

<p>A â€˜cold resetâ€™ is a fundamental reset that takes place after power is applied to a PCIe device. There appears to be no standard way of triggering a cold reset, save for turning the system off and back on again. On my machines, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/sys/bus/pci/slots</code> directory is empty.</p>

<p>A â€˜warm resetâ€™ is a fundamental reset that is triggered without disconnecting power from the device. There appears to be no standard way of triggering a warm reset.</p>

<p>A â€˜hot resetâ€™ is a conventional reset that is triggered across a PCI express link. A hot reset is triggered either when a link is forced into electrical idle or by sending TS1 and TS2 ordered sets with the hot reset bit set. Software can initiate a hot reset by setting and then clearing the secondary bus reset bit in the bridge control register in the PCI configuration space of the bridge port upstream of the device.</p>

<p>A â€˜function-level resetâ€™ (FLR) is a reset that affects only a single function of a PCI express device. It must not reset the entire PCIe device. Implementing function-level resets is not required by the PCIe specification. A function-level reset is initiated by setting the initiate function-level reset bit in the functionâ€™s device control register in the PCI express capability structure in the PCI configuration space.</p>

<p>Linux exposes the function-level reset functionality in the form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/sys/bus/pci/devices/$dev/reset</code>. Writing a 1 to this file will initiate a function-level reset on the corresponding function. Note that this only affects that specific function of the device, not the whole device, and devices are not required to implement function-level resets as per the PCIe specification.</p>

<p>I am not aware of any â€˜niceâ€™ method for triggering a hot reset (there is no sysfs entry for that). However, it is possible to use setpci to do so:</p>

<p>Ensure that all attached drivers are unloaded before running this script. This script will attempt to remove the PCIe device, then command the upstream switch port to issue a hot reset, then attempt to rescan the PCIe bus. This script has also only been tested on devices with a single function, so it may need some reworking for devices with multiple functions.</p>
